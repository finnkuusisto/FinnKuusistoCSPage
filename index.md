# Hi

I'm currently working on wearable human-computer interfaces at [FANTM](https://www.getfantm.com), a company I cofounded in Madison in 2020.

I completed my PhD in the [Computer Sciences](http://www.cs.wisc.edu) department at [UW-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu) in 2015, doing research in [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/areas/ai/index.html) with [Jude Shavlik](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shavlik/), [David Page](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/david.page), and [Elizabeth Burnside](https://www.radiology.wisc.edu/profile/elizabeth-burnside-8/). My work focused primarily on breast cancer prediction applications related to overdiagnosis, estimation of individualized treatment effects, and precision medicine in general.

After grad school, I worked as a postdoc in [Regenerative Biology](https://morgridge.org/research/regenerative-biology/) with [Jamie Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Thomson_(cell_biologist)) and [Ron Stewart](https://morgridge.org/profile/ron-stewart/) at the [Morgridge Institute](https://morgridge.org/) to build models from genetic expression data that can predict when compounds are toxic to developing neural tissues, along with a lot of work around text mining for drug repurposing and cell reprogramming.
