# Hi

I'm currently a data scientist at [UW-Madison's](http://www.wisc.edu) [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute/about-afidsi/). I help several investigators across campus with their AI and data science needs, and assist with the design and composition of technical portions for proposals. I'm also an AI Integration Officer with [Department of the Air Force / MIT AI Accelerator](https://aia.mit.edu).

From 2020 through 2022 I worked on [FANTM](https://www.getfantm.com), a company I cofounded in Madison to develop wearable human-computer interfaces.

I completed my PhD in the [Computer Sciences](http://www.cs.wisc.edu) department at [UW-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu) in 2015, doing research in [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/areas/ai/index.html) with [Jude Shavlik](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shavlik/), [David Page](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/david.page), and [Elizabeth Burnside](https://www.radiology.wisc.edu/profile/elizabeth-burnside-8/). My work focused primarily on breast cancer prediction applications related to overdiagnosis, estimation of individualized treatment effects, and precision medicine in general.

After grad school, I worked as a postdoc in [Regenerative Biology](https://morgridge.org/research/regenerative-biology/) with [Jamie Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Thomson_(cell_biologist)) and [Ron Stewart](https://morgridge.org/profile/ron-stewart/) at the [Morgridge Institute](https://morgridge.org/) to build models from genetic expression data that can predict when compounds are toxic to developing neural tissues, along with a lot of work around text mining for drug repurposing and cell reprogramming.
